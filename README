* Guix configuration
This is my personal set of configuration files built around the [[https://guix.gnu.org/][GNU Guix]] package manager and the [[https://git.sr.ht/~abcdw/rde][RDE]] configuration framework.

The main goal behind this repository is to hold the configurations of my users, hosts, and remote machines in a single dispatch entry point. For the most part, I stick to the RDE principles to choose my tooling and I try to contribute to and maintain related programs.

- OS/Package Manager :: GNU Guix
- Window Manager :: dwl-guile
- Status Bar :: dtao-guile
- Menu Prompt :: bemenu + j4-dmenu-desktop
- Browser :: Nyxt
- Text Editor :: GNU Emacs
- Video Player :: mpv

To build and activate my configurations, invoke one of the following commands:

#+begin_src sh
# To activate the current user's home
make home
# For a specific user
make home/reconfigure/$USER
# To activate the current hostname's config
make system
# For a specific host
make system/reconfigure/$HOST
# To deploy an entire configuration for a remote machine
make deploy/$HOST/$USER
#+end_src

To alleviate maintenance burden, I prefer working on top of Guix community [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Channels.html][channels]] to implement new features, which I define through lock files under the =./rde/= directory. If you wish to reproduce one of my setups, please make sure to consult the pinned commits on these files.

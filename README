* Guix Configuration
This is my personal set of configuration files built around the [[https://guix.gnu.org/][GNU Guix]] package manager and the [[https://git.sr.ht/~abcdw/rde][RDE]] configuration framework.

To build and activate my configurations, invoke one of the following commands:

#+begin_src sh
# To activate the current user's home
make home
# For a specific user
make home/reconfigure/$USER
# To activate the current hostname's config
make system
# For a specific host
make system/reconfigure/$HOST
# To deploy an entire configuration for a remote machine
make deploy/$HOST/$USER
#+end_src

To alleviate maintenance burden, I prefer working on top of Guix community [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Channels.html][channels]] to implement new features, which I define through lock files under the =./rde/= directory. If you wish to reproduce one of my setups, please make sure to consult the pinned commits on these files.

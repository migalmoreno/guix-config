* Guix Configuration
This is my personal set of configuration files built around the [[https://guix.gnu.org/][GNU Guix]] package manager and the [[https://git.sr.ht/~abcdw/rde][RDE]] configuration framework.

To activate the current user's home configuration:

#+begin_src sh
make home
#+end_src

To activate a specific user's home configuration:

#+begin_src sh
make home/reconfigure/$USER
#+end_src

To activate the current host's system configuration:

#+begin_src sh
make system
#+end_src

To activate a specific host's system configuration:

#+begin_src sh
make system/reconfigure/$HOST
#+end_src

To deploy an entire system configuration and home configuration to a remote machine:

#+begin_src sh
make deploy/$HOST/$USER
#+end_src

To alleviate maintenance burden, I prefer working on top of Guix community [[https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/Channels.html][channels]] to implement new features, which I define through lock files under the =./rde/= directory. If you wish to reproduce one of my setups, please make sure to consult the pinned commits on these files.
